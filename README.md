# nand-Adder
The code provided is an implementation of a digital logic circuit using NAND gates. It defines functions for basic logic operations such as 
NAND, NOT, AND, OR, and XOR. The code also includes functions for a half adder and a full adder, which are circuits used for binary 
addition.

The main function of the code acts as a command-line interface, allowing the user to run the program in either diagnostic mode or compute mode. 
  - In diagnostic mode, the code performs the defined logic operations on provided input bits and compares the results with the expected        values, printing them to the console. This mode helps in verifying the correctness of the logic operations.
  - In compute mode, the code takes three input bits representing A, B, and Cin (carry-in), and computes the result of a full adder circuit     using the provided input.
     -  It then prints the computed result, including the output bit and the overflow (carry-out).

The code demonstrates how basic logic gates can be combined to build more complex circuits, such as adders, using the principle of Boolean logic. It provides a practical example of digital logic design and simulation in the context of an adder circuit, which is a fundamental component in computer arithmetic.
